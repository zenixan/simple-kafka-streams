/**
 * Represents a set of aggregation functions for a changelog stream.
 *
 * @tparam K  a type of primary key
 * @tparam V  a type of record value
 *
 * @define aggregateDesc
 * Returns a new table with unmodified keys and values that represent the latest (rolling) aggregate for each key.
 *
 * Aggregating is a generalization of reduce and allows, for example, the aggregate value to have a different type
 * than the input values.
 *
 * The behavior of this operation is:
 *  - Records with `null` keys are ignored.
 *  - When a record key is received for the first time, the initializer is called (and called before the adder).
 *  - When the first non-`null` value is received for a key then only the adder is called.
 *  - When subsequent non-`null` values are received for a key, then
 *    (1) the subtractor is called with the old value as stored in the table and
 *    (2) the adder is called with the new value of the input record that was just received.
 *    The order of execution for the subtractor and adder is not defined.
 *  - When a tombstone record (record with a `null` value) is received for a key then only the subtractor is called.
 *    Note that, whenever the subtractor returns a `null` value itself, then the corresponding key is removed from
 *    the resulting table. If that happens, any next input record for that key will re-initialize its aggregate value.
